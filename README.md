This is a data analysis of Energy consumption in Netherlands where the data are taken from https://www.kaggle.com/lucabasa/dutch-energy. The detail of this dataset are as below quoted from the Kaggle page:

    Enexis, Liander, and Stedin are the three major network administrators of the Netherlands and, together, they provide energy to nearly the entire country. Every year, they release on their websites a table with the energy consumption of the areas under their administration.

    The data are anonymized by aggregating the Zipcodes so that every entry describes at least 10 connections.

    This market is not competitive, meaning that the zones are assigned. This means that every year they roughly provide energy to the same zipcodes. Small changes can happen from year to year either for a change of management or for a different aggregation of zipcodes.

     Content:

    Every file contains information about groups of zipcodes managed by one of the three companies for a specific year.

    About this file:
    Every file is from a network administrator from a specific year.

     The columns in each file are:

* `net_manager` : code of the regional network manager
* `purchase_area`: code of the area where the energy is purchased
* `street`: Name of the street
* `zipcode_from` and `zipcode_to`: 2 columns for the range of zipcodes covered, 4 numbers and 2 letters
* `city`: Name of the city
* `num_connections`: Number of connections in the range of zipcodes
* `delivery_perc`: percentage of the net consumption of electricity or gas. The lower, the more energy was given back to the grid (for example if you have solar panels)
* `perc_of_active_connections`: Percentage of active connections in the zipcode range
* `type_of_connection`: principal type of connection in the zipcode range. For electricity is # fuses X # amp√®re. For gas is G4, G6, G10, G16, G25
* `type_conn_perc`: percentage of presence of the principal type of connection in the zipcode range
* `annual_consume`: Annual consume. Kwh for electricity, m3 for gas
* `annual_consume_lowtarif_perc`: Percentage of consume during the low tarif hours. From 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. and during weekends.
* `smartmeter_perc`: percentage of smartmeters in the zipcode ranges
